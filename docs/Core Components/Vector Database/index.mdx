## What is a Vector Database?

Vector databases are a type of database that stores data as high-dimensional vectors. These vectors are used to represent the semantic or contextual meaning of data. Vector databases are used for vector search, which is a type of search that finds the most similar or relevant data based on their vector distance or similarity.
