# Action Console

The Action Console is used when you are running a permission-based agent. When the agent is running, you can provide directions to the agent before it proceeds to execute the next action such as approving the action, denying and denying with feedback.

You can either choose to approve an action or deny, either by providing feedback or denying the action as it is.
