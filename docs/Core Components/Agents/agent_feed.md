# Agent Feed

The agent feed page provides you with complete, real-time visibility of the activities performed by the agent. 

By looking through the Agent Feed, you can understand the agentâ€™s thought process, the results it is obtaining from tools, and its status whether the interaction was a success.

You can also use the agent feed along with a permission-based agent to intervene if you would like to provide direction to the agent - whether you would like to agree, disagree, or provide the agent with feedback using which the agent would proceed with the next step.
