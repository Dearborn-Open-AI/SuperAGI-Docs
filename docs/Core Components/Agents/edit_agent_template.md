# Edit Agent Template

You can make changes to an existing template - such as modifying the goals, instructions, toolkits, the agent type, etc.

When you make changes to an agent template, it does not affect the provisioned agent. However, using the updated agent template, you can start provisioning new agents with the changes you've made to the template.
