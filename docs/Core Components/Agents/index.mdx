# Agents

Agents in SuperAGI are complex systems that leverage the power of LLMs to operate independently, reason, perform tasks, and takes decisions without the constant need for human intervention. 

The Agents, plan, reason, interact with toolkits, and execute based on the user's Goals, Instructions, Resources, and Constraints to achieve the expected results.
