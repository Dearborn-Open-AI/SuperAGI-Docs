# Introduction to SuperAGI

A dev-first open source autonomous AI agent framework enabling developers to build, manage & run useful autonomous agents. You can run concurrent agents seamlessly, extend agent capabilities with tools. The agents efficiently perform a variety of tasks and continually improve their performance with each subsequent run.

## Features

- **Provision, Spawn & Deploy Autonomous AI Agents**
- **Extend Agent Capabilities with Tools**
- **Run Concurrent Agents Seamlessly**
- **Graphical User Interface** - Access your agents through a graphical user interface.
- **Action Console** - Interact with agents by giving them input and permissions.
- **Multiple Vector DBs** - Connect to multiple Vector DBs to enhance your agentâ€™s performance.
- **Multi-Modal Agents** - Use various forms of inputs to train the agents.
- **Agent Trajectory Fine-Tuning** - Agents learn and improve their performance over time with feedback loops.
- **Performance Telemetry** - Get insights into your agentâ€™s performance and optimize accordingly.
- **Optimized Token Usage** - Control token usage to manage costs effectively.
- **Agent Memory Storage** - Enable your agents to learn and adapt by storing their memory.
- **Looping Detection Heuristics** - Get notified when agents get stuck in the loop, provide proactive resolution.
- **Concurrent Agents** - Run multiple agents simultaneously to improve efficiency and productivity.
- **Resource Manager** - Read and store files generated by Agents.
