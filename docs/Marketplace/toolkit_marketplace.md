# Toolkit Marketplace

The SuperAGI Toolkit Marketplace, accessible at **[marketplace.superagi.com](https://marketplace.superagi.com/)**, serves as a centralized repository of toolkits developed by SuperAGI. It contains a collection of specialized tools that can be integrated into the agents. By browsing the marketplace, users can access, review, and install essential tools to enhance the capabilities of their agents.

### Toolkit Listings

Each toolkit in the marketplace comes with detailed information, which includes:

- **Toolkit Name**: The unique identifier for each toolkit.
- **Description**: A brief summary outlining the toolkit's primary functions and features.
- **List of Tools**: An itemized breakdown of all the tools contained within the toolkit.

### **Installation Process**

1. **Browsing the Marketplace**: Navigate to **[marketplace.superagi.com](https://marketplace.superagi.com/)** and explore all available toolkits. Users can delve into the details and functionality of each toolkit.
2. **Toolkit Selection**: Once a desired toolkit has been identified, click on its listing to view in-depth information and installation options.
3. **Installation**: Click on the "Install" button associated with the toolkit. This will initiate the integration process with the agent.
4. **Confirmation**: After a successful installation, a confirmation message will be displayed, confirming that the toolkit is now available for the agent's use.

### **Usage Considerations**

- **Toolkit Dependency**: Agents can only utilize tools from the toolkits that have been installed. Without proper installation, access to these tools will be restricted.
- **Updates**: It's crucial to regularly check the marketplace for toolkit updates to ensure optimal performance and the latest features.
- **Uninstallation**: If a toolkit is no longer required, users can uninstall it from their agent's setup through the marketplace interface.

### **Contributing to the Marketplace**

Currently, we are working on the capability for users to add their own tools to the Toolkit Marketplace. The process and guidelines for contributing Toolkits is coming soon!
